# Windows-File-Grabber
File grabber for windows machines. This is used for formatting computers, it is not to be used for malicious purposes.

This is used for grabbing the files of a windows machine upon execution. This script grabs all files from Documents, Pictures, and Desktop. For the Desktop, it specifically grabs:

.pdf(s),
.docx
.pptx
.xlsx
.txt
Other file extensions can be added to this as necessary.

The reason for this is to grab only the essential documents, while applications are not copied and take up all the space on the drive.
